# Data-Science-Notebook-Comprehension-Task

Welcome to the upwork task:

This is an experiment to understand the comprehension process of a data scientist for a given data science task.

The task requires you to answer program comprehension questions related to the given data science notebook. The experiment will be recorded in Skype (only screen sharing) and will be used only for research purposes. The notebook that is provided is developed using Jupyter notebook and Python as a programming language by another data scientist. 

By taking part in the experiment, you provide your consent for the screen share recording. You will require ~1.5 hours in total to complete this task.

---Instructions---

You will be given:
* A notebook solving a data science task and its corresponding data files
* A set of program comprehension questions
* You may or may not receive additional information on the notebook

You will need to:
* record the answers for the questions (in exact order) in the survery questions.

At the end of the experiment we will obtain the following things:
* The recording of the experiment while answering the questions in screen-sharing mode
* answers to the questions
* modified code to the original notebook if any

The notebook given to you solves the following data science task:
- Compare housing and rental prices in five major cities on the United States’ west coast. Five major cities in this task are: Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Diego.
- Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/zillow/zecon
- Raw data files: ‘data/data_dictionary.csv', 'data/cities_crosswalk.csv' (both of them are available in this github repo's data folder) and 'western_states_time_series.csv' (separately provided by us)
- A description of the variables can be found in: ‘data_dictionary.csv'
- Hypothesis to be tested: “Housing and rental prices in five major cities on the United States’ west coast are correlated”.

We will share the questions (where you can record the answers as well) with you.
